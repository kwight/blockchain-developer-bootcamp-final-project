# ConsenSys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project

## Charity Fun Run

Charities sometimes do fundraisers often called "fun runs": participants raise funds from others based on their participation in a run/walk event. On the day of the event, the participant does the run, and may collect the funds themselves from their doners. The participant then turns over the funds to the charity.

My final project will implement all? some? of the contract and mechanisms needed for a charity to host a fun run with maximum transparency for all involved.

#### How does a blockchain help?
A public blockchain of events and results can improve a charity's commitment to transparency for all involved. Depending on how they're organized, typical charity fun runs can involve a fair amount of trust:
- participants trust doners will pay out,
- doners trust participants perform in the event,
- charities trust participants that collect funds will turn over all of the funds, and
- participants and doners trust the charity accurately reports the results of the fundraising.

A public blockchain can improve the visibility of all actors' actions and commitments at every stage of the fundraising event, growing goodwill for the charity in the community.
