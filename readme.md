# CryptoGive

CryptoGive is a platform for donating to your choice of charity programs with cryptocurrency.

## How does a blockchain help?

Donation platforms already exist â€“ how is one based on a public blockchain an improvement?

- Ease of use: Anyone with a wallet can donate, regardless of banking or credit access, in amounts that are not always possible with traditional currency.
- Trust: Public blockchains can remove the need for trust between parties, as all transfers and wallet balances can be confirmed and scrutinized.
- Transparency: Charitable activity is easily verified in the open, and doners can more easily track and confirm their own activity across multiple charities.
- Speed and efficiency: Donations land in charities' wallets immediately, with no intermediaries taking a cut. Minimal infrastructure or technical needs are required by the charity.

## How does CryptoGive work?

The platform owner can register charities, who in turn register programs/campaigns. Potential doners select from the active programs available and donate an amount in ether (which is then transferred to the address of the charity).

#### Owners

The owner is the address that deployed the contract. The owner can:

* Register new charities.
* Remove existing charities.

#### Charities

A charity must first be registered by the owner to be considered active. A registered charity can:

* Register a new program.
* Cancel an active program.
* Declare an active program completed.
* Remove themselves from the platform (not available in the UI).

#### Doners

Anyone can be a doner to any active program, and see their own past donations.
